# KHealthCertificate

Parsing of digital vaccination, test and recovery certificates.

## Supported Formats

The following certificate formats can be parsed:

* Digital Infrastructure for Vaccination Open Credentialing (DIVOC), the system used for Indian vaccination certificates (see https://divoc.egov.org.in/)
* EU "Digital Green Certificate" (DCG) vaccination, test and recovery certificates (see https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates)

## Use Case

Warning: This is merely meant to check what is in your own trusted certificates, this does not
validate signatures and is therefore not suitable for checking untrusted certificates.
